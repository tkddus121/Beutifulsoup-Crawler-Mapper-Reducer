            When I was younger I saw
            My daddy cry and curse at the wind
            He broke his own heart and I watched
            As he tried to reassemble it
            And my momma swore that she would
            Never let herself forget
            And that was the day that I promised
            I'd never sing of love if it does not exist



            Maybe I know somewhere
            Deep in my soul that love never lasts
            And we've got to find other ways
            To make it alone or keep a straight face
            And I've always lived like this
            Keeping a comfortable distance
            And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
            Because none of it was ever worth the risk



            I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
            Let go of what's in front of me here
            I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
            Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, whoa
